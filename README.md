# Joy Audio ðŸŽµðŸŽ‰  

## What's the Vibe?  
Joy Audio is all about taking the coolest audio generation models (think MusicGen, AudioLM,..) and giving them a fresh, simplified twist in PyTorch. Why? So we can crank up efficiency for ONNX/TensorRT-powered inference. Oh, and it comes with a demoâ€”because what's a masterpiece without showing it off?  

Also here to get experimental! New architectures like Flow Matching? Yep, weâ€™re diving in. And for the grand finale? A Vietnamese music generation model packed with *authentic Vietnamese vibes*. ðŸŽ¶

## The Master Plan (Sorta)  
### Roadmap & Timeline  
- *Doesnâ€™t exist yet.*  
- Totally depends on whenever I can sneak in some free time. No pressure, no deadlinesâ€”just vibes and progress! ðŸ˜Ž  

Let the music (and code) flow! ðŸ› ðŸŽ§
